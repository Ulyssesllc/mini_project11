# Mini Project 11: Fundamentals of Optimization

This repository contains a pipeline for benchmarking and analyzing algorithms for a vehicle routing problem with passengers and parcels. It includes:

- **algorithms 202416763/**: Implementations of different algorithms (`dijkstra.py`, `greedy.py`, `hill_climbing.py`, `metaheuristic.py`).
- **helpers 202416763/**: Helper scripts for generating test cases, running tests, and analyzing results.
- **test_cases/**: Input CSV files for various problem sizes.
- **results/**: Output CSVs and plots generated by the pipeline.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Test Case Generation**
   - Use `helpers 202416763/generator.py` to generate new test cases if needed.

2. **Running Algorithms**
   - Run `helpers 202416763/tester.py` to execute all algorithms on all test cases.
   - Results are saved to `results/compare_results.csv` and a summary table is printed and saved as `results/results_table.png`.

3. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - After testing, `helpers 202416763/analyze_results.py` is called automatically to generate plots and summary statistics in the `results/` folder.

## How to Use

1. **Install Requirements**
   - Python 3.8+
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib tabulate
     ```

2. **Run the Pipeline**
   ```bash
   python helpers\ 202416763/tester.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Run all algorithms on all test cases
   - Save results and plots in the `results/` folder

3. **View Results**
   - Check the `results/` folder for CSVs and PNGs.
   - The main results table is in `results/results_table.png`.
   - Plots for cost, route length, and runtime are also available.
